# Quantum Thot Responsible Patent License (QTRPL) v1.1

## 1. Grant of Rights
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, including Sections 3 and 4, the Licensor grants to You a worldwide, non-exclusive license under Licensor’s copyrights to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Software.

## 2. Patent Grant
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, including Sections 3 and 4, the Licensor hereby grants You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive license under Licensor’s patent rights to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Software.

## 3. Revenue and Surcharge Conditions
a. If You are an individual or entity with less than USD $1,000,000 in annual gross revenue, this License is royalty-free.  

b. If You exceed USD $1,000,000 annual gross revenue, You must remit to the Licensor, at Licensor’s discretion:  
   - Ten percent (10%) surcharge on all invoices related to Quantum Cloud compute services used in conjunction with the Software; **or**  
   - Twenty-five percent (25%) surcharge on the amortized cost of owned quantum compute hardware used in conjunction with the Software.  

c. Surcharges are payable quarterly and subject to audit under Section 8.  

## 4. Responsible Use Conditions
This License is granted only on the condition that You agree to abide by the following Responsible AI standards:

### 4.1 Prohibition on Fully Automated AGI Researcher Agents
You may not use the Software to develop, deploy, or operate fully automated AGI researcher agents without continuous, meaningful human oversight.  

### 4.2 Dangerous Capabilities Restrictions
You may not use the Software for the purpose of developing or deploying systems primarily intended for:  
- Offensive cyber operations (including discovery and exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities).  
- The design, simulation, or deployment of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons.  
- Autonomous self-replication, propagation, or agent proliferation without containment.  

### 4.3 Human-in-the-Loop Requirement
All critical decisions made by systems built using the Software must include effective mechanisms for meaningful human control.  

### 4.4 Safety Evaluation Requirement
Prior to deploying any model trained or fine-tuned with the Software beyond state-of-the-art benchmarks, You must conduct safety evaluations proportionate to the potential risk. Results must be documented, and catastrophic failure modes must be disclosed responsibly.  

### 4.5 International Law and Human Rights
This License terminates immediately if You use the Software in violation of international law, including war crimes, terrorism, or crimes against humanity.  

### 4.6 Alignment Research Carve-Out
Nothing in this License prohibits bona fide research into alignment, interpretability, or robustness, provided such research does not result in violation of clauses 4.1–4.5.  

### 4.7 Standards Body Participation
As a condition of this License, Licensees must affiliate with and actively
support at least one recognized standards-setting organization or consortium
concerned with AGI safety and research oversight. This may include, but is
not limited to, academic consortia, nonprofit foundations, or industry
alliances dedicated to responsible AGI development.

Active involvement means attending meetings, contributing to shared safety
protocols, and supporting cooperative red-teaming. It does **not** require
disclosure of proprietary trade secrets, model weights, or confidential
research pipelines.

The specific organizations qualifying under this clause may be updated by the
Licensor in future versions of this License. Failure to maintain such an
affiliation shall constitute a material breach of this License. There is no
grandfathering: all Licensees must comply with this requirement as of the
date of adoption.  

## 5. Termination
Your rights under this License shall terminate automatically if You (a) breach Section 4, or (b) initiate patent litigation against any entity alleging that the Software infringes a patent.  

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty
The Software is provided “AS IS”, without warranty of any kind. Licensor shall not be liable for damages of any kind arising from use of the Software.  

## 7. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Licensor be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from or related to this License or the use of the Software.  

## 8. Auditability
Licensees exceeding the $1,000,000 revenue threshold agree to maintain accurate records of compute expenditures related to the Software and to permit reasonable independent audit by the Licensor or its designee.  

## 9. Treaty-Readiness Clause
This License is designed to be compatible with future international regulatory frameworks governing frontier AI systems. Each subsection of Section 4 is modular and may be incorporated by reference into national or international treaties without modification.
