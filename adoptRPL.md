## Adopting RPL

The **Responsible Patent License (e.g. QTRPL v1)** is designed not
just for this project, but as a reusable framework for any researcher,
developer, or company who wants to align their work with responsible AGI
practices.

### How to Adopt
1. Copy the `LICENSE.md` file into your own repository or project.
2. Add a `NOTICE.md` (or a short README section) stating that your project is
   distributed under **QTRPL v1.1**.
3. Make clear if you have any project-specific modifications to the license
   (for example, narrower revenue thresholds or additional conditions).

### Why Adopt
- **Patent & copyright protection** â€” structured like Apache 2.0, but updated
  for frontier AI.
- **Responsible AI standards baked in** â€” no fully automated AGI researcher
  agents, no dual-use offense, human-in-the-loop requirements, and mandatory
  affiliation with at least one standards-setting body.
- **Treaty-readiness** â€” each clause is modular and can map directly to
  future international AI safety frameworks.

### Realpolitik-assumptions 
- the idea of a do-or-die arms race with China is assumed to not be totally false, rather than the USPTO being used as a competitive moat and incentive to SRO formation is a worthwhile trade-off 

- in contrast to the all-in concepts espoused in papers like Situational Awareness, potentially setting standards that can be readily adopted by future treaties. 

- The CCP wants dominance and control but not loss of control to ASI, neither do most US-based elites. 

- Open source/decentralized AGI research conversely will be taxed by latency and sparser resources and incurs a penalty that makes collective research community oversight more plausible without requiring global totalitarian control of the internet. 

- A definition of "AGI" and "responsible" built into the premise is AI agents capable of general reasoning to the extent that they can at least replace 2 our of 3 employees with the 3rd being responsible for oversight in at least 30% of information-based jobs. This is a more modest definition than some, and does not imply consciousness, self-improving or fully autonomous agents. Reponsible means, embracing a trade-off away from secrecy, primacy, priority, dominance or a prospective take-off in favor of peer-review, mechanistic interpretability and agent compartmentalization.

These assumptions may be naive or accurate but are the premises of the license.

### Signaling Adoption
If you adopt RPL, consider adding a badge or note such as:

ðŸ”’ Licensed under RPL v1 â€” committed to responsible AGI development.
